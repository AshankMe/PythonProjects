# CSTIMER REMIX

This program is based off of a website, "cstimer.net". 

I coded this with the inspiration of wanting to know my rubix cube stats.

You may or may not know about my interest in speedcubing, but I wanted to be able to find my average time when I entered a time into the program, so here I am!

This is made by me, and only me.
