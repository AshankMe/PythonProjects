# Rock Paper Scissors 

This projects is based fully on the rock paper scissors game.

This project works by taking one of these words from the user: ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']. The computer then uses the random module to pick on of those 3 words as well. When this happens, if statements are used to determine who won!

This is made by me, and only me.
