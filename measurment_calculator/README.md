# Measurment Calc

This measurment calculator is made by me, and only me.


What this program does, is it takes in input from the user, asking the user what the unit of measurment requested is. 

Then, it runs a function depending on the unit of measurement, and takes in numbers from the user, based on the unit, and then converts it.
