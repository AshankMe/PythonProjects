# Number Guessing

This is a simple game, consisting of this:

The Computer takes in the number that the user is guessing, and then randomly picks a number between 1 and 5. Then, the computer tells the user whether the number is too high or low, allowing the user to guess up to 5 times.

This is made by me, and only me.
